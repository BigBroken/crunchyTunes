There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
A music player and aggregator built on the Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud APIs.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
For anyone who has ever had to manage multiple music libraries across multiple websites, and would rather consolidate their music collection into a single, searchable library.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Crunchy Tunes frees you from the effort of navigating through SoundCloud, YouTube and Spotify, whether it would be in your search of a particular song, or to playback a specific song.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Crunchy Tunes allows the user to have a single and simple libray, comprised of their entire music collection across multiple websites.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Crunchy Tunes allows the user to have a single library, and the songs in their library can be from any compatible source (SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify).

## Quote from You ##
  My library has never been so crunchy before.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  It's as easy as registering, searching a song, and adding it to your playlist.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Before Crunchy Tunes, I would always have to pull up my SoundCloud, YouTube and Spotify accounts whenever I wanted to spend time enjoying my music. Since the artists I enjoy release different songs across different platforms, I could never have my entire music collection in one place. An artist would release official studio albums only on Spotify, remixes and mixtapes only on SoundCloud, and if I wanted to watch the music video, I would have to go to YouTube. Now, regardless of what I want to do, I only have to go to one website - Crunchy Tunes!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
