## Customer Quote ##
  "Before Crunchy Tunes, I would always have to pull up my SoundCloud, YouTube and Spotify accounts whenever I wanted to spend time enjoying my music. Since the artists I enjoy release different songs across different websites/platforms, I could never have my entire music collection in one place. An artist would release official studio albums only on Spotify, remixes and mixtapes only on SoundCloud, and if I wanted to watch the music video, I would have to go to YouTube. Now, regardless of what I want to do, I only have to go to one website - CrunchyTunes.com!" - Dan in Ohio
